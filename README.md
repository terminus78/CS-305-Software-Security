# CS-305-Software-Security

**Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?**

> Artemis Financial is a ficticious company that designs plans for savings, retirement, investments, and insurance. They were looking into how to secure their customer financial data and ensure secure communications when sending and recieving said data. This was part of their process of modernizing their business.

**What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?**

> I believe that I did very well in using the Maven dependency checker. It is very important to code securely because vulnerabilities in the code are one of the very common ways in which attackers gain access to systems. Quality, secure code helps to ensure that attackers are thwarted, and, in case they do manage to breach the system, that their attack does minimal damage. Security is a necessity to minimize malicious use and system breaches. These vulnerabilities can cause massive losses, not only in monetary value, but in customer trust. Once lost, that trust is next to impossible to regain.

**What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?**

> I found the use of the Spring framework very difficult due to my lack of experience with it. It was exceedingly hard to learn this framework while also trying to learn about security and the many layers of encryption, certificates, and secure coding that were necessary. If would have had more time, I would have liked to gain a deeper understanding of Spring.

**How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?**

> I increased the layers of security by using secure keys, dependency checks, data encryption, and secure coding. The Maven dependency checker is quite convenient in finding vulnerabilities. I can see myself using it many times in the future.

**How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?**

> I did a manual review of the code first by looking through each file line by line. Then, I ran the Maven dependency checker to see if there were any new vulnerabilities introduced.

**What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?**

> The National Vulnerability Database was very helpful in understanding vulnerabilities. I will very likely use it again in the future.

**Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?**

> I would show future employers the document that is in this repository to show all that I did to find vulnerabilities and design secure software.
